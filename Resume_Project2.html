    <h2>A Banking Simulator</h2>

                different bank agents working in synchronization with one another. " width = "700">

    <p><b>Description:</b><br>
        A Java application that creates a fictious bank compromised of different bank agents
        who have different functions. Synchronization is required for two reasons – (1)
        mutual exclusion (updates cannot be lost) and (2) because a
        withdrawal cannot occur if the amount of the withdrawal request is greater than
        the current balance in the account. This means that access to the account (the
        shared object) must be synchronized.</p>

    <br>

    <p><b>Skills Learned:</b><br>
        <p>
        - Applications which require cooperation and synchronization of multiple threads of execution. <br>
        - Increased proficiency with Java.
